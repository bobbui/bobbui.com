      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">About me</h2>
      <div class="text-base">
        <p>
          I didn't grow up with much. My father passed away when I was young, and a computer wasn't in the picture. The
          first time I touched one was 2004. I felt late on day one.
        </p>

        <p>
          In college I struggled. My classmates had years of practice; I was still finding the shortcuts. I stayed after
          hours, asked "basic" questions, and rewrote the same assignments until they ran. By graduation my thesis
          ranked at the top—less talent, more persistence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early career looked similar. I took the unglamorous tickets, fixed things at odd hours, and learned how real
          systems fail. I moved from IC to lead to architect, but I still try to be the person who rolls up sleeves
          first and argues about tools later.
        </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">A few wins I'm proud of</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-muted dark:text-slate-300">
            <li>Helped rescue a late rebuild and get it live. Faster pages, smaller bills, happier users.</li>
            <li>Worked with data science to move models from notebooks to production—less demo, more uptime.</li>
            <li>Built pipelines so people didn't have to copy-paste from a thousand PDFs. Small fixes, real impact.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-6 space-y-3">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">What guides me now</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-muted dark:text-slate-300">
            <li>Ground answers in facts. If it isn't anchored, it's guesswork.</li>
            <li>Be honest about trade-offs: latency, cost, quality. Measure and decide on purpose.</li>
            <li>Good tooling beats heroics. Onboarding should take hours, not weeks.</li>
            <li>Leaders should still read code and remember where it breaks.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          I'm building an AI product on the side. Nothing flashy—useful. It's for messy data, real questions, and
          answers you can trust with citations and speed. Nights and weekends are enough when the problem matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          If parts of this feel familiar—late start, steep learning, shipping anyway—follow along. I'll share what
          works, what doesn't, and everything in between.
